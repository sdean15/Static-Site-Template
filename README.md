## Getting Started
This template website is NOT for real production use of any sort. It was just for fun. No information is real.
Make sure you get node_modules before running the dev server.

First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js` or editing the components within the 'components' folder. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
